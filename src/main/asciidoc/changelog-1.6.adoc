==== Improvements

* On `JdbcLifecycleEventListener`, method names have updated to map invoked method name only
  (classname has removed) in order to improve the interception for overloaded methods.

==== Breaking Changes

* `JdbcLifecycleEventListener` method names have changed.  +
  (e.g.: `beforeGetConnectionOnDataSource()` => `beforeGetConnection()`)
+
--
Previously, the method names on the listener had convention of:
`[before|after]<MethodName>On<ClassName>`  +
e.g.: `beforeGetConnectionOnDataSource()`  +
This has changed to `[before|after]<MethodName>`  +
e.g.: `beforeGetConnection()`

For overloaded methods (e.g.: `Statement#execute` and `PreparedStatement#execute`), please reference the
documentation: <<jdbclifecycleeventlistener-overloaded-methods>>
